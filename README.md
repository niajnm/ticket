# 🎟️ Ticket App – Flutter

A simple Flutter application developed as part of the **Mobile App Developer – Flutter** task for **Gain Solutions Ltd**.
The app demonstrates **MVVM architecture**, **Repository pattern**, **State Management with Provider**, and **API simulation using static JSON data**.

---

* Filter button in the **top-right corner**.
* Navigates to a **Filter Screen**.
* User can **select multiple filter options** dynamically (from simulated JSON API).

---

## 🚀 Features

### 1. Ticket Screen

* Displays a **list of tickets**.
* Includes a **Filter button in the top-right corner**.
* On tap, navigates to the **Filter Screen**.

### 2. Filter Screen

* Fetches **filter options** dynamically from static JSON (simulated API).
* **Number of filters is dynamic** (sometimes 3, sometimes 5).
* UI adapts automatically.
* Allows the user to **select multiple filter options at once**.
* Selected filters are applied back to the **Ticket Screen**.

### 3. Contact Screen

* Search screen for user contacts.
* Displays results from static JSON data.

### 4. Profile Screen

* Shows user details such as **Name, Email, and Profile Picture**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Flutter** (UI + Business logic)
* **Dart** (OOP, clean code principles)
* **Provider** (state management)
* **MVVM + Repository Pattern**

  * Repository layer abstracts **local JSON fetching** (API simulation).
  * Easy to replace with real APIs later.
* **Service Locator (GetIt)** for **Dependency Injection**
* **AppUtils Static Functions** (optimized for lower RAM consumption).
* **CI/CD with GitHub Actions** (automated build & test pipeline).
* **Light & Dark Theme support**

Got it! Here’s a concise **Environment** section you can add to your README with only the essential items like Flutter version, Dart version, DevTools, and SDK:

---

## 🖥️ Environment

* **Flutter**: 3.35.4 
* **Dart**: 3.9.2
* **DevTools**: 2.48.0

---
## ⚡ API Simulation

* Static JSON files under **assets/** simulate API responses.
* Example:

  * `tickets_local_source.dart` → loads `assets/tickets.json`
  * `contacts_local_source.dart` → loads `assets/contacts.json`
  * `profile_local_source.dart` → loads `assets/profile.json`
* Repository layer provides an abstraction for fetching data.
* Service Locator injects repositories into ViewModels.
* ViewModels expose data to the UI using **Provider**.

---

## 🔄 CI/CD

* GitHub Actions workflow added for:

  * Automated build
  * Lint checks

## 📦 Download APK

You can download and test the latest build of the app from Google Drive:

👉 [Download APK](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pStTD5kMulsDG3Mf_W7ehRiY6A19sJU0?usp=sharing)

This project is integrated with **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration and delivery.
Whenever you push to the repository, a workflow is triggered to build the Flutter APK.

## 📌 Notes

* This project’s **core implementation is local JSON + MVVM + Repository Pattern**.
* **Dio setup** is included only as a **reference** to show how real API integration can be achieved.

  * Implemented as **Singleton** for optimization.
  * Includes **Interceptors** (logging, headers, error handling).
  * Makes migration to real API seamless.
